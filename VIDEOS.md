# NeRF Video Content Plans

## Overview

Two compelling video demonstrations planned for showcasing the NeRF training and rendering capabilities on consumer hardware.

---

## 1. Training Evolution Time-lapse

### Concept

A time-lapse video showing the evolution of NeRF quality throughout the entire training process.

### Technical Specifications

- **Duration**: 20 seconds
- **Frame Rate**: 10 FPS
- **Total Frames**: 200 images
- **Sampling**: Render at every 1,000 iterations (0 → 200,000)
- **Resolution**: 400×400 (upscale to 1080p in post-processing)
- **Camera**: Fixed viewpoint for consistency

### Visual Progression

- **Start**: Blank/noise rendering (iteration 0)
- **Early**: Rough shapes and colors emerge (1K-10K iterations)
- **Middle**: Details and structure develop (10K-100K iterations)
- **End**: High-quality final rendering (200K iterations)

### Implementation Notes

- Add checkpoint rendering to training script every 1,000 iterations
- Use identical camera pose for all renders
- Consistent lighting and background settings
- Export as PNG sequence → MP4 compilation

### Impact

- Demonstrates training convergence visually
- Shows quality evolution on consumer hardware
- Compelling social media / presentation content

## 2. Interactive Fly-through Demo

### Concept

A smooth camera flight around the rendered NeRF model showcasing different viewpoints and angles.

### Technical Specifications

- **Format**: Looping video or GIF
- **Duration**: TBD (likely 10-30 seconds)
- **Camera Path**: Spherical trajectory with altitude variation
- **Viewpoints**: Multiple angles, elevations, and distances
- **Seamless Loop**: Start/end positions match for continuous playback

### Camera Movement Design

- **Orbital Motion**: Camera circles around the model
- **Altitude Variation**: Smooth height changes throughout flight
- **Look-at Target**: Always focused on model center
- **Speed Variation**: Slower at interesting angles, faster during transitions
- **Smooth Transitions**: Continuous motion without jarring cuts

### Rendering Approach

- **High Quality**: Best trained model (200K iterations)
- **Consistent Settings**: Fixed lighting, background, and quality parameters
- **Multiple Resolutions**:
  - High-res for presentation (1080p)
  - Optimized for web/social media (720p)
  - GIF version for easy sharing

### Implementation Strategy

- Generate camera path using spherical coordinates
- Interpolate smooth transitions between keyframes
- Batch render all frames
- Post-process for consistent quality and color
- Export multiple formats (MP4, GIF, high-res)

### Showcase Value

- Demonstrates novel view synthesis capabilities
- Shows model quality from multiple perspectives
- Interactive NeRF demonstration without requiring real-time viewer
- Perfect for presentations and portfolio content
